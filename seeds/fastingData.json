There are no requirements about which foods to eat, but rather when you should eat.  The two days are chosen by the individual, but there needs to be at least one non-fasting day in between them.",

The modified version limits your calories on fasting days to 500 or 25% of your normal intake, and eat normally on all other days.",

For example, the 16/8 method means only eat between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. or noon and 8p.m.  The 14/10 method means only eat between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.  The most popular time-restricted preference for many people is to eat between noon and 8 p.m., as this means they will only need to fast overnight and skip breakfast before eating a balanced lunch and dinner along with snacks during the day.",
